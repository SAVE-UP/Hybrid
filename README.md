# Hybrid
THE CHALLENGE | INTERNET ON THE OCEAN The internet is not easily accessible in many areas of the world, like the Earth’s oceans. Fishermen, sailors, and others have limited data connection with the rest of the world. Although satellite internet is widely available, it is very expensive for a user to implement. Your challenge is to design a low-cost method of delivering internet to people located far away on the ocean.

Our solution is called "Hybrid", it is a mix between community networks, the Internet of Things Network and Internet over satelitte. "Hybrid" is an inter-connected box who creates a Mesh Network.

INTRODUCTION
We chose the challenge INTERNET ON THE OCEAN, because as on the seas as in sub-Saharan Africa and in the rural regions of Egypt and Africa the access to the stable internet at reasonable price is a daily challenge. We have already experimented with community networks and this has been a huge success despite the challenges.



SOLUTION
Our solution is called Hybrid, it is a mix between community networks, the Internet of Things Network and Internet over satelitte. Hybrid is an inter-connected box who creates a Mesh Network. This network is coupled to Hybrid receivers that allow them to connect to the mesh network. It's easy to use and transparent for the user.

Our solutions as already mentioned are based on community networks. These community networks are booming in Africa and sounds based on Node link between them, it form a mesh network, which can cover several countries, this is the case of Guifi, Freifunk Network. Put on marine beacon it will provide a reliable low cost internet connection. In order to create an Internet redundancy can be provided both by Satellites (The Satellites are connected only to the Super-Nodes in high seas.) And by the Beacon to the sols.

The Intenet connection is done by 5Ghz and by Connection V-sat ( Ka Band) of COMSAT. We also integrate a Lora node in all at all points of the system to ensure that the ship can transmit data (geolocation, short message etc ...) to the nearest node over distances that can not cover the wifi.

Finally in high seas where the objects move perpetually, the detremination of the position in the receiver is important that is why we think about the trilateralisation. to accurately determine the vessels to provide a stable service.


IMPACT
The low rate of super-nodes compared to conventional nodes makes the system less expensive than a 100% satelite solution

People will communicate at a lower cost but also machines. A network of IoT based on the sea will allow to connect nons ships not only ships but also off-shore platforms etc ...

The data collected by the Internet of Things can feed a platform for the prevention of major climate disasters.

For the future

In the future, the system should play an important security role in maritime, exploration platforms and especially ships protections.
